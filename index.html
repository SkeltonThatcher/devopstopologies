            <div class="sub-heading">
                <p>Exactly which DevOps team structure or topology will suit an organisation depends on several things:</p></div>

            <i class="custom-icon icon-businessman271">&#xe800;</i>
            <p>The extent, strength, and effectiveness of technical leadership; whether Dev and Ops have a shared goal.</p>
        </div>  
            
        <div class="col-1-4">
            <i class="custom-icon icon-monitor145">&#xe803;</i>
            <p>Whether an organisation has the capability or appetite to change its IT Operations department from ‘racking hardware’ and ‘configuring servers’ to real alignment with the value stream, and for operational features to be taken seriously by software teams.</p>

            <p>Of course, there are variations on the themes outlined here; the topologies and types are meant as a reference guide or heuristic for assessing which patterns might be appropriate. In reality, a combination of more than one pattern, or one pattern transforming into another, will often be the best approach.</p>

            <p>So what team structure is right for DevOps to flourish? Clearly, there is no magic conformation or team topology which will suit every organisation. However, it is useful to characterise a small number of different models for team structures, some of which suit certain organisations better than others. By exploring the strengths and weaknesses of these team structures (or ‘topologies’), we can identify the team structure which might work best for DevOps practices in our own organisations, taking into account Conway’s Law.</p>

        <div class="col-1-2">
            <p>Most of these DevOps topologies have been described elsewhere before; in particular, Lawrence Sweeney of CollabNet goes into useful detail in a comment on Ben Kepes’s blog about what I characterise here as <a href="#anti-type-b">Anti-Type B (DevOps Silo)</a>, <a href="#type-three">Type 3 (IaaS)</a>, and <a href="#type-one">Type 1 (Smooth Integration)</a>. The DevOpsGuys have a list of Twelve DevOps Anti-Patterns, and Jez Humble, Gene Kim, Damon Edwards (and many others) have said similar things. I have added here three additional ‘topologies’ which I’ve not seen or heard discussed much (<a href="#type-two">Fully Embedded</a>, <a href="#type-four">DevOps-as-a-Service</a>, and <a href="#type-five">Temporary DevOps Team</a>).</p>

            <p>We likely all know this topology is bad, but I think there are actually worse topologies; at least with Anti-Type A (Separate Silos), we know there is a problem.</p>

            <h5><strong>Anti-Type B:</strong> Separate DevOps Silo</h5>

            <p>The DevOps Silo (Anti-Type B) typically results from a manager or exec deciding that they “need a bit of this DevOps thing” and starting a ‘DevOps team’ (probably full of people known as ‘a DevOp‘). The members of the DevOps team quickly form another silo, keeping Dev and Ops further apart than ever as they defend their corner, skills, and toolset from the ‘clueless Devs’ and ‘dinosaur Ops’ people.</p>

            <p>The only situation where a separate DevOps silo really makes sense is when the team is temporary, lasting less than (say) 12 or 18 months, with the express purpose of bringing Dev and Ops closer together, and with a clear mandate to make the DevOps team superfluous after that time; this becomes what I have called a <a href="#type-five">Type 5 DevOps Topology</a>.</p>

            <h5><strong>Anti-Type C:</strong> "We Don't Need Ops"</h5>

            <p>This topology is borne of a combination of naivety and arrogance from developers and development managers, particularly when starting on new projects or systems. Assuming that Ops is now a thing of the past (“we have the Cloud now, right?”), the developers wildly underestimate the complexity and importance of operational skills and activities, and believe that they can do without them, or just cover them in spare hours.</p>

            <p>Such an Anti-Type C DevOps topology will probably end up needing either a <a href="#type-three">Type 3 (IaaS)</a> or a <a href="#type-four">Type 4 DevOps topology (DevOps-as-a-Service)</a> when their software becomes more involved and operational activities start to swamp ‘development’ (aka coding) time. If only such teams recognised the importance of Operations as a discipline as important and valuable as software development, they would be able to avoid much pain and unnecessary (and quite basic) operational mistakes.</p>

            <h5><strong>Type 1:</strong> Smooth Collaboration</h5>

            <p>This is the ‘promised land’ of DevOps: smooth collaboration between Dev teams and Ops teams, each specialising where needed, but also sharing where needed. There are likely many separate Dev teams, each working on a separate or semi-separate product stack.</p>

            <p>My sense is that the Type 1 Smooth Collaboration model needs quite substantial organisational change to establish it, and a good degree of competence higher up in the technical management team. Dev and Ops must have a clearly expressed and demonstrably effective shared goal (‘Delivering Reliable, Frequent Changes’, or whatever). Ops folk must be comfortable pairing with Devs and get to grips with test-driven coding and Git, and Devs must take operational features seriously and seek out Ops people for input into logging implementations, and so on, all of which needs quite a culture change from the recent past.</p>

            <p>Where operations people have been fully embedded within product development teams, we see a Type 2 topology. There is so little separation between Dev and Ops that all people are highly focused on a shared purpose; this is arguable a form of <a href="#type-one">Type 1</a>, but it has some special features.</p>

            <p>Organisations such as Netflix and Facebook with effectively a single web-based product have achieved this Type 2 Fully Embedded topology, but I think it’s probably not hugely applicable outside a narrow product focus, because the budgetary constraints and context-switching typically present in an organisation with multiple product streams will probably force Dev and Ops further apart (say, back to a <a href="#type-one">Type 1 model</a>). The Fully Embedded topology might also be called ‘NoOps‘, as there is no distinct or visible Operations team (although the Netflix NoOps might also be <a href="#type-three">Type 3, IaaS</a>).</p>

            <p>For organisations with a fairly traditional IT Operations department which cannot or will not change rapidly [enough], and for organisations who run all their applications in the public cloud (Amazon EC2, Rackspace, Azure, etc.), it probably helps to treat Operations as a team who simply provide the elastic infrastructure on which applications are deployed and run; the internal Ops team is thus directly equivalent to Amazon EC2, or Infrastructure-as-a-Service.</p>

            <p>A team (perhaps a virtual team) within Dev then acts as a source of expertise about operational features, metrics, monitoring, server provisioning, etc., and probably does most of the communication with the IaaS team. This team is still a Dev team, however, following standard practices like TDD, CI, iterative development, coaching, etc.</p>

            <p>The IaaS topology trades some potential effectiveness (losing direct collaboration with Ops people) for easier implementation, possibly deriving value more quickly than by trying for <a href="#type-one">Type 1 (Smooth Collaboration)</a> which could be attempted at a later date.</p>

            <p>Within organisations that have a large gap between Dev and Ops (or the tendency towards a large gap), it can be effective to have a 'facilitating' DevOps team that keeps the Dev and Ops sides talking. This is a version of <a href="#type-5">Type 5 (Temporary DevOps Team)</a> but where the DevOps team exists on an ongoing basis with the specific remit of facilitating collaboration and cooperation between Dev and Ops teams.

            <h5><strong>Type 7:</strong> SRE Team (Google)</h5>

            <p>DevOps often recommends that Dev teams join the on-call rota, but it's not essential. In fact, some organisations (including Google) run a different model, with an explicit 'hand-off' from Development to the team that runs the software, the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team. In this model, the Dev teams need to provide test evidence (logs, metrics, etc..) to the SRE team showing that their software is of a good enough standard to be supported by the SRE team.</p>

            <p>Crucially, the SRE team can reject software that is operationally substandard, asking the Developers to improve the code before it is put into Production. Collaboration between Dev and SRE happens around operational criteria but once the SRE team is happy with the code, they (and not the Dev team) support it in Production.</p>
